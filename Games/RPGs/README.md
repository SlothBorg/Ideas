Ideas of RPGs:

* [FitD](https://bladesinthedark.com/) + White Wolf mosnter games:
  * Vampire
  * Mage
  * Werewolf
  * Mummy
  * etc.
* The lost annals, trio of games exploring magic and magic users
  * apprentices journey with their mentor / a Gandalf like figure as he goes on a magical quest
  * The last 8 days of magic, up to the end of magic in the modern era
  * After the loss, explose magic users after they have lost their ability to do magic.
* RPG where you are the tragic remains of a great treasure hunt, the Hobbit but smaug killed most everyone. You are on your journey home with the treasure, which poses a huge logistical, not to mention exconomic issue.
* FitD + Burning Wheel
* FitD + ARS Magica
* RPG that takes inspiration from [Root](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/237182/root)'s playmats and aysmetrical game play
